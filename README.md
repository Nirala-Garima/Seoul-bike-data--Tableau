# Seoul-bike-data--Tableau

## Important points/Steps:-
# This seoul bike data visualization includes only data from 2018.
*The “YEAR(Date)” variable is in the filter field and is check marked for 2018 only.

# The data visualization includes only weekdays, Monday to Friday.
*The “WEEKDAY(Date)” variable is in the filter field and is check marked for Monday through Friday only.
*The “Hour” variable in the filter field is check marked on the hours 8 to 17. 

# The data visualization type makes sense for the data shown and includes color, contrast, labeling, and emphasis elements that focus on  the most relevant data.
*The chart selected was a bar chart. A scatter plot and box plot could be helpful, but would likely be too complex for the purpose of the visualization. A geographic map would not be helpful at all since there is no geographic data.
*The light shade of orange and peach bars represent viable times of day and dark orange are times in which bike rental traffic is too high for maintenance to be viable.
*Annotations are added to highlight the relevant information.
